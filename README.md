# Unity3D-AR_PokemonCards
A proof-of-concept prototype project to bring pokemon cards to life using Vuforia's Augment Reality API.

Placing down a Pikuchu card infront of a camera creates a 2D sprite of Pikuchu in 3D space that roams around your desk in realtime!
He can be interacted with by placing down a power-up card; causing Pikachu to react and move towards it.
